## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will this load Google Fonts automatically?

No, each font set must be manually triggered. Automatic loading of assets from a third party server is forbidden by the [plugin guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/)

### My fonts do not show up on the settings page, what can I do?

Fonts are discovered once they are used. Try to browser your front end first and get back to the settings page.

### My fonts are not replaced, what can I do?

The plugin currently only checks fonts embedded via `wp_enqueue_style` if you use Google fonts via `@import` you have to change that first.
