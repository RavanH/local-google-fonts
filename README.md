## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will this load Google Fonts automatically?

Yes, if you check the option to load fonts automatically. Otherwise each font set must be manually triggered.

### Is it Legal to Self-Host Google Fonts?

Yes. The open source fonts from Google Fonts are published under a licenses that allow you to use them on any website, no matter if itâ€™s commercial or personal.

### My fonts do not show up on the settings page, what can I do?

Fonts are discovered once they are used. Try to browse your front end first and get back to the settings page.

### My fonts are not replaced, what can I do?

The plugin currently only checks fonts embedded via [`wp_enqueue_style`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_style/) if you use Google fonts via `@import` you have to change that first.

### The Divi theme still loads a Google font?
